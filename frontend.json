This is your computer’s unique address on the internet. Without an IP Address, websites would not be able to deliver their content to you given that they would not be able find your computer on the internet. Since each time you disconnect and reconnect to the internet a new IP Address is automatically assigned to your computer, IP Addresses are not inherently capable of identifying you as an individual (at least, by themselves and not combined with other identifiers). An IP Address does, however, contain information regarding the location of your computer on the internet (your country), and the name of your ISP, and which when combined with other available information may lead to your identification.

To earn staking rewards, simply select the asset you wish to stake and once it has finished bonding, it will be ready to start staking and earning rewards twice a week from the Proof of Stake process.",

Proof of Stake works differently by choosing from a pool of people holding the Proof of Stake coin. A Proof of Stake “validator node” can be added to the pool by staking coins for a certain period of time, giving Proof of Stake validators a source of income without needing powerful mining hardware.",
